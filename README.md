Configuration Files for NeoVim
=========================================

This repository contains my configuration files for NeoVim. I have almost switched to Spacemacs, so I rarely use NeoVim now. I just keep these files in case I switch back to vim in the future. 

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/akirak/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
